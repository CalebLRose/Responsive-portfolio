					<p>Hi, My name is Caleb Rose. I've lived a few places, all in Texas. Houston is where I came into this world but, it wasn't long until we made our first move. My mother and I moved down to Laredo, Tx in 1991. We stayed there until September of 1999 when we moved to a small East Texas town called Kilgore. It was a nice place to finish school. I made a lot of good friends there who I still keep in touch with today. After high school, I moved to San Antonio. I guess I just missed South Texas. Then after about a year there I moved to Austin. Austin is an interesting place. I loved it there, felt at home there. However, it is easy to burn out in Austin and, that is just what I did. It was a fun time.</p>
					<p>I also have a fairly diverse work background. I've worked in construction, live sound and studio recording, even opened a coffee shop with some friends. There is so much that is interesting in this world and I never wanted to choose just one. I really like to learn. One year my mom took out a small loan to get us a set of encyclopedias. I still think it might have been the best gift ever.</p>
					<p>Music will always be my first love. I've had a guitar for as long as I remember. When middle school band came around, I really wanted to play the Tumpet. Unfortunately there were quite a few other kids that beat me to it. I ended up playing Bassoon, a double reeded supersized oboe. I spent all of high school and most of my 20s in and out of different bands, mostly playing guitar and bass. I eventually had my folk revival period where just me and an acoustic guitar sufficed. Now, on the music front, changed paths again. This happened after, on a whim, I purchased my first synthesizer. With this a new obsession was born.</p>
